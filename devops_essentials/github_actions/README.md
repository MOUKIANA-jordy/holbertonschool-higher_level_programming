Docker allows users to create lightweight and portable containers from custom images. One of the most lightweight base images used in Docker containers is Alpine, a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution.

Objective:
Create a Docker image using the Alpine base image. When a container is run using this image, it should print “Hello, World!” to the console.
